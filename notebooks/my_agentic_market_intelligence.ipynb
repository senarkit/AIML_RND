Idea\n","\n","This notebook explores how multi-agent AI systems can autonomously gather and analyze market intelligence to help startups evaluate product ideas.\n","\n","We build AI agents that perform the following tasks:\n","\n","1. **Web Scraping** – Using LlamaIndex's simple web crawler to collect market data from relevant sources.\n","2. **Sentiment Analysis** – Analyzing customer sentiment about similar products or industry trends.\n","3. **Competitive Intelligence** – Extracting key insights about competitors, potential gaps, and market trends.\n","\n","### Why This Matters for Startups\n","\n","- **Validate Product-Market Fit:** Identify if the startup’s product idea has demand.\n","- **Understand Competitor Positioning:** Learn from existing competitors and their market strategies.\n","- **Discover Emerging Trends:** Use AI-driven insights to spot trends that influence product development.\n","\n","### Requirements\n","Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:\n","- `llama-index`\n","- `beautifulsoup4`\n","- `requests`\n","\n","Let's begin by setting up the required tools and agents.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"e55a2749","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"id":"e55a2749","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738392678647,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":42683,"user":{"displayName":"Arkit","userId":"11410772436352750600"}},"outputId":"6a7afcb6-8cf7-4aad-92fd-78228013cd91"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting
